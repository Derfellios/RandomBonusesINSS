This Warzone mod extends Fizzer's randomized bonuses mod in three ways:

1) You can choose how much randomly can be subtracted and how much can be added seperatedly.

2) For some INSS templates (at the moment only "Landria" and "Biomes of America"), the bonuses which should be altered are hard-coded. This makes rnadomized bonuses and INSS playable.

3) The new randimization mode "Timi random" which is inspired by Timinator. Each bonus value is set to n-1 or n-2, each with a 50% chance. This overwrites the maximum subtraction/addition per bonus
